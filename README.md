**Album Description**:  

*DRAKKAR* is an odyssey through the shadows, a soundtrack for the restless souls caught between pain and ambition, love and despair. Inspired by the dark allure of Drakkar Noir—the cologne that signifies more than its scent—this album dives deep into the struggles that define us. It’s about the cost of identity, where the name on the label matters more than the essence within, reflecting a world obsessed with image over truth.  

Each track captures the raw emotion of navigating wealth, heartbreak, and self-destruction while embracing a vampiric edge—dripping in the mystery and decadence of a Playboi Carti or Destroy Lonely lifestyle. It’s the night before Valentine’s Day, a time when the darkness of solitude challenges the light of love. Will you let the love in, or remain lost in the shadows?  

*DRAKKAR* is *Nixe!*’s most personal work, a reflection of his battles with depression, the weight of his past, and the temptation to give in to despair. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest times, there’s a strange beauty, a value found in the struggle—just as Drakkar Noir is coveted not for its scent, but for its identity.
